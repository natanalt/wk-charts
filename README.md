# wk-charts
Small website application for taking Japanese text files and generating charts that map [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com) levels to kanji comprehension in the input.

Apologize for the meh quality code, this is literally the first time I'm using modern webdev tooling lmao

## Building and running
Standard [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) commands:
```sh
# Run Vite dev server
npm run dev
# Build static files into `dist/` folder
npm run build
# Preview files as output by the build command
npm run preview
```
